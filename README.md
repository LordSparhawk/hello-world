Initial test repo

I, Lord Sparhawk,  am a knight in the Pandion Order.  I follow my Queen, Ehlana, ruler of the kingdom of Elenia.
Some know me as Anakha - the One Whose Fate the Gods Do Not Know.  Others call me wielder of Bhelliom and flee from my sight. 
My only valued possession is my sword, my only companion is a foul-tempered horse I name Faran.
